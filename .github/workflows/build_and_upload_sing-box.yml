          # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.
